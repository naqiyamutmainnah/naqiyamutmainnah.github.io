                <p>
                    For four months, I consistently practiced and explored data science using Google Colab. I started with the basics of Python and data structures, then moved on to descriptive and inferential statistics to build a solid foundation in data analysis. Along the way, I worked with Pandas for data manipulation, created visualizations using various tools, and used SQL to query and manage data. I also dove into natural language processing (NLP) ‚Äî including sentiment analysis and text classification ‚Äî explored time series forecasting, and built machine learning models for different predictive tasks.

                <p>
                    I used Power BI, Figma, Flourish to create visualizations that made sense of data about ecosystem services and water knowledge in the Sariharjo region. By digging into the data, I was able to turn complicated information into easy-to-understand visuals that highlighted the important insights. This project gave me the chance to show how I can not only analyze data but also turn it into stories that are both engaging and informative.

                <p>
                    The system automatically grades student short answer essays by matching the wording of student responses against reference answers according to ROUGE evaluation metric. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measures the quality of summaries by looking at overlapping units such as n-grams, word sequences or pairs. Through the evaluation of the precision, recall and F1 scoreof these overlaps, it provides an objectiveized but reasonable qualification criteria to distinguish student performance with fairness.

                    I worked on a project where I used an ARIMA model to predict aluminum prices, which helped the company make smarter pricing decisions. I started by collecting and cleaning historical market data, then did some deep exploratory analysis to spot trends and seasonal patterns. After fine-tuning the ARIMA model, I was able to provide accurate short-term forecasts, which made a big difference in the company's market planning and inventory management.

                <p>
                    I've used Power BI a lot to create data-driven dashboards for different projects. One example is a dashboard that analyzes Prime Video's films and TV shows, showing insights like the number of films by genre and director, ratings across genres, and show distribution through interactive maps. This helps users spot trends and make better decisions. I also worked on a real-time COVID-19 dashboard for Indonesia, tracking cases, deaths, and recoveries, with maps to highlight regional trends. These projects show how I use Power BI to turn data into clear and actionable insights.

The final result was a clean, functional, and visually appealing website that worked well across different devices and kept users engaged.

                <p>
                    For the Bantu Aku Apps, we started by cleaning the data to keep things consistent, then did some exploratory analysis and segmentation to uncover key trends and patterns. We used interactive charts and dashboards to make everything easy to understand, helping with decision-making. Before diving into machine learning, we split the data into training and testing sets, and selected the most relevant features. This app is designed to give small business owners in Indonesia the insights they need to grow and manage their businesses with data-driven strategies.
